OS Droid Buddy
-------

Be in the know at this year’s Droidcon event with OS Droidbuddy, using Ordnance Survey’s overlay mapping you will be able to tweet your thoughts, views and location all from this fantastic application, built using our OS Android SDK, just an example of some of the fantastic applications you could be building this year with OS.

Key Features:

* An Overview map of the UK, defaulting to the Droidcon 2013 location
* See where you are in comparison to the Droidcon event on the map
* View latest OS / Droidcon related Tweets
* Send an OS Droidcon tweet from App
* View tweets made by other visitor in a visual geographical context

The Android OS OpenSpace SDK will enable you to create free and commercial mobile applications with our data. It provides access to a number of mapping layers and gazetteer lookups and has a similar API to Google Maps, so that moving from Google mapping to Ordnance Survey mapping is simple.
